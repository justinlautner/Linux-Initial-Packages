# Linux-Initial-Packages

## My most important linux packages, all in one place, for making a fresh install nice and simple. Also, this way i cannot possibly forget to install something i need desperately, and wonder later why it isnt working. :)

### If for some reason you ended up here, and have the same need for organization and specific packages... Well, we've just won the lottery!

#### Heres how to claim your prize: 
To allow permission to run the script:
---------------
```
cd /path/to/target

chmod +x the_file_name
```
To then run the script:
------------------
```
cd /path/to/target

./packages
```
